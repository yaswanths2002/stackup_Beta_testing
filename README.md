# Stackup_Beta_testing

As of now there are no problems in the discord the engagment of the users and team is amazing.

I would like to suggest a bot which I came across recent times when I was going through the internet.

### About Bot
Name of the bot : Daily Memer
Bot link : https://top.gg/bot/977206243770908702

The bot automatically sends new memes to the server every day providing a constant source of entertainment and engagement for community members. This can help encourage casual interactions between users and also they can request specific memes using the `/meme` command which allows them to share relevant memes during discussions.This feature can create a fun atomsphere within the community.
