# Stackup_Beta_testing

As of now, there are no problems in the discord the engagement of the users and team is amazing.

I want to suggest a bot that I came across recently times when I was going through the internet.

## About Bot
#### Name of the bot: Daily Memer

#### Bot link: https://top.gg/bot/977206243770908702

The bot automatically sends new memes to the server every day providing a constant source of entertainment and engagement for community members. This can help encourage casual interactions between users and request specific memes using the `/meme` command, allowing them to share relevant memes during discussions. This feature can create a fun atmosphere within the community.
